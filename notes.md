### E2C Instance

- elastic IP address is 3.227.194.2

### Caddy

- Forward Proxy: hides client, used for anonymity and filtering
- Reverse Proxy: hides server, used for load balancing and protection

### HTML

- Use svg to make colored shapes with pure html. Helps to make placeholders and other things.
- Make your homepage index.html because that will be the first page the web looks for. For me make that the login page.
- LiveServer VSCode extension is super useful for showing you what your site looks like and editing in real time.
- You can use a script to deploy files to your remote server which hosts your web application.

### CSS

- Tailwind CSS is nice because it's done inside the HTML and doesn't require bouncing between CSS and HTML files.
- Tailwind only creates CSS files for what you use unlike Bootstrap which requires downloading the whole library
