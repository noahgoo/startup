# MasteryLab

## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

Engineers constantly learn how to solve complex problems that need to be worked out. Are you able to make a simple flashcard to remember how to
solve the problem? Probably not, because questions like this need repitition and continous testing. Let's make it easier with MasteryLab, an
online web application that allows users to create custom quizzes with their homework problems, practice test questions, and other material. 
A simple alogrithm will let users try to solve a question, self check if they got the answer right, and rework the ones the missed. It's a much 
more effective and efficient way to master those difficult concepts and skills.
